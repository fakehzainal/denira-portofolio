                    The Covid-19 pandemic period is a momentum for companies and employees to understand the importance of implementing Occupational Health and Safety (K3) in the workplace. Also considering that currently Indonesia is still in the duration of commemorating the National OHS Month every year on 12 January-12 February. The theme for OHS Month 2021 is 'Strengthening Superior Human Resources and OHS Culture in All Business Sectors'.
                    Referring to the theme, it can at least be interpreted that K3 is an important key to business continuity and worker/labor protection in the context of preventing and overcoming Covid-19, the rest is to create a safe, comfortable, healthy workplace leading to zero accidents in order to increase productivity in companies where work.
                    Understanding K3 in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
                    In the midst of the current Covid-19 pandemic, a number of parties, including the private sector, are required to implement strict health protocols. This fact is important, especially regarding work safety in production sites or factories. It is logical, if in the current Covid-19 pandemic situation, the economy must continue to run by prioritizing preventive measures and of course K3 is carried out in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations, the rest can refer to government regulations through the Indonesian Ministry of Health which has issued a decree. Minister of Health Number HK.01.07/MENKES/328/2020 concerning Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Covid-19 in the Office and Industrial Workplace in Supporting Business Continuity in a Pandemic Situation.
                    In addition, usually existing companies or workplaces already have P2K3 (Occupational Safety and Health Supervisory Committee) referring to the Regulation of the Minister of Manpower (Permenaker) RI Number PER. 04/MEN/1987 which essentially states that the existing auxiliary agency in the workplace is a forum for cooperation between employers and workers to develop mutual understanding and effective participation in the implementation of OHS, so that the active role of companies is expected to be able to break the Covid-19 rope faster. in the workplace. Because the current Covid-19 virus can infect anyone, and anywhere. Even that step, will be more complete when the implementation of K3 is increasingly heeded and complied with by all workplaces.
                    Departing from that reality, understanding K3 in the midst of Covid-19 is really urgent. The reason is, after all, the Covid-19 pandemic has given wisdom that changes in new work procedures have been carried out. On the other hand, we are entering the era of the industrial revolution 4.0 where there are several types of old jobs that are lost and several types of new jobs that appear. With the emergence of new types of work, potential hazards have just begun. Control strategies to prevent accidents and occupational diseases are carried out and anticipated so that adaptation to new habits becomes meaningful for K3.
                    In addition, understanding K3 in the midst of the current Covid-19 pandemic is important to be applied in the workplace environment. Because, after all, the application of K3 is an important key to business continuity and worker protection in the context of preventing and overcoming Covid-19. Therefore, the role of K3 in the implementation of the company is very urgent. The reason is, his role is to always maintain the conditions in the company so that occupational health and safety is maintained properly continuously.
                    Third, the increasing number of employees who implement a technology-based Occupational Safety and Health Management System (SMK3). Since we are currently still in the Covid-19 pandemic, through technology-based SMK3 if the entire series of activities can be held in virtual form or in the form of activities that do not require face-to-face so that the company's management system as a whole in the context of controlling risks related to work activities, the creation of a safe, efficient, and productive workplace can be realized. This is, at least in line with the government's program, and in accordance with the direction of the Ministry of Manpower through the Decree of the Minister of Manpower No. 365 of 2020 concerning the Implementation Guidelines for the 2021 National OHS Month.
                    Fourth, the application of K3 during the Covid-19 pandemic could be implemented by opening an K3 Command Post which is an active effort by opening consultation information services, and complaints for workers related to Occupational Health and Safety in the company. This postal service can be accessed online, making it easier for the public to access it from anywhere and anytime.
                    Through the four contributions of thought about the application of K3 in the midst of Covid-19 that the authors offer above, if implemented properly, it is very likely that occupational health and safety can be well maintained and the workplace can minimize the potential for the spread of Covid-19. Likewise, along with the vaccine, hopefully our country can soon be free from this pandemic disease, so that we can quickly recover from health conditions, employment conditions and economic conditions and return to normal conditions as before.
